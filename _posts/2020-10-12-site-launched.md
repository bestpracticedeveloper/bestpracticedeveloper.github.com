Software Development is more than coding. A good developer also writes maintainable, reusable and testable code. They understand handy tools, the product's requirement (usually with guidance, but not necessarily), and future trend. So a developer is also a fast learner, a listener, and with an open mind.

This site shares everything about a best practiced developer: personal and professional development tips, good books, industry news, etc.
