"Huawei predicts that by the end of 2020, the price of a 5G module will be reduced to around US$100, and further to around US$40 by the end of 2022."

At the forum, Huawei proposed a 5G development goal called “1+N” and released a full range of 5G solutions that support “1+N” to build a 5G minimalist network.

Yang Chaobin, President of Huawei’s Wireless Network Product Line, said: “To create the golden decade of 5G together, we need a full spectrum to move towards 5G and build a minimalist target network with universal coverage and wide pipelines and N-dimensional capabilities on demand.”

On this basis, Huawei proposed a “1+N” 5G target network, evolving from the full spectrum to 5G, and build a broad pipeline basic network with universal coverage with IF large bandwidth as the core; use other frequency bands to build differentiated advantages to achieve N The maintenance capabilities are superimposed on demand.

To this end, Huawei has released a number of products focusing on improving 5G networks. Including the industry's first Blade AAU Pro solution that supports 64T64R Massive MIMO and Sub3G full band integration.
