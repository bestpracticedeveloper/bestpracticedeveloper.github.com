The disruption and transformation of large-scale models has only just begun. ChatGPT has gained widespread popularity, reshaping multiple scenarios and industries such as search and office collaboration. In online education, it is considered to be the most important vertical scenario, as the capabilities exhibited by large language models are precisely what online education and AI teachers urgently require. 

Furthermore, this trend has already begun, and online education applications related to large-scale models have already taken the lead in overseas markets. The solution to transforming GPT into a second-dimensional AI tutor for solving math problems is here.

From the basics of trigonometric functions to the complexities of different problem-solving methods and techniques, step-by-step answers can be obtained. This is the recent hot trend of AI problem-solving applications that are trending overseas, and the associated app - TuTorEva has been topping the education category charts on the App Store. 

This popularity is reasonable: backed by LLM and with a second-dimensional artistic style reminiscent of "Genshin Impact," it has truly gone virus. Prior to this, the mainstream "AI tutors" in the online education industry were essentially just recommendation algorithms, which means recommending pre-recorded teaching videos or problem-solving methods, but unable to provide answers to certain details within the videos or methods. However, now with LLM's emergence and its accuracy in problem-solving and language comprehension capabilities, it has begun to make breakthroughs in previously unattainable technical implementations - not only is online education facing a reshaping, but the entire education industry is undergoing a reshaping.

## The Technical Details Behind
This anime girl, TutorEva is powered by LLM in the field of AI automatic problem solving. The basic idea is to integrate LLM into the existing workflow at both ends and form a Joint Model mode with CLM (Computational Language Model) in the original workflow. Compared to other AI models, CLM exhibits decent logical reasoning ability, but its language understanding ability and output still pale in comparison to large language models like GPT-4. Joint Model mode allows LLM to provide NLP ability while CLM provides logical reasoning ability. The entire process of AI problem solving now involves input of the problem statement, text processing by LLM, problem solving by CLM, text generation by LLM, and explanation output. The combined capability of the two models can tackle more complex reasoning tasks than individual models and collect relevant data if necessary. Therefore, the AI tutor can understand the problem statement well and provide explanations. 

Before LLM is integrated at both ends, CLM can also provide the mathematical and logical reasoning ability required by the AI tutor. This mainly relies on CLM to upgrade the textual information into higher-dimensional data, allowing the machine to simultaneously accept multi-dimensional implicit information such as entities, relationships, parameters, and knowledge behind the text, and understand what needs to be solved ultimately. CLM is then set to "partial non-recall," meaning "the AI will not output the result for questions that cannot be guaranteed to be 100% correct," to ensure that the explanations and final answers provided by the AI tutor are always accurate. This also explains why the application focus of LLM in the Joint Model mode is on NLP rather than logical reasoning ability. 

Since the emergence of large models like GPT-3.5, mathematical and logical reasoning abilities have emerged suddenly, but they are not stable and not absolutely reliable. The AI tutor cannot use them directly after being integrated. Instead of focusing on correcting the "nonsense" of LLM, it is better to focus on utilizing its relatively stable NLP ability.

## Who's Behind the App

It is interesting that the AI tutor actually comes from a Chinese company. Founded in 2017 by a core team from Tsinghua and Peking University, XiZhi Intelligent is the first company in China to focus on automatic problem-solving in education, and is the first in China to develop a multi-modal problem-solving tutoring platform. 

In the early stages of entering the AI education industry, the company caught the right timing and received angel funding of RMB 10 million from "DF Innovation" (a subsidiary of New Oriental) in the second year of its establishment. By 2020, the company had completed nearly RMB 100 million in Series A funding. 

However, due to the “double reduction” policy in China in 2021, the company had to shift its focus to overseas markets. Just when it was preparing to enter new markets, the emergence of ChatGPT with its logical reasoning abilities broke the industry's traditional understanding and disrupted the company's plans: "We originally thought that AI would not have logical reasoning abilities so quickly. We not only underestimated OpenAI's progress in the GPT series, but also underestimated the strength of the abilities that GPT has emerged with." said Sun Yiqiao, founder and CEO of the company.
